I tried to rework the code from the example we got it class today, but I kept coming up with errors.
I worked with Zach and Claudia. Zach especially helped with the formula and Claudia spotted some syntax errors I'd made. I still couldn't get the equation to work, with help from Chareesa and Mel (I needed help more than a couple times) I found my variables were not being redefined the way I intended.

Once I had it working, I added storeName and hour variables and appended each of the outputs with the store name and the hourly with the hour, so that it is clear which store received which sales and at what hour.
After looking at my code again later. I realized that I had switched the footTrafficCeiling and footTrafficFloor in some of the "var"s and I needed to add a space , so I fixed that and created a new pull request. I pasted the new results below.



Here's the output from my new code:
